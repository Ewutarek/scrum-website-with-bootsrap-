                <h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An agile framework for getting work done and <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile</a> is a mindset. Scrum assists you in getting into an agile   mindset by practicing on
                            building on the principles in all aspects of your life.</li> 
                        <li>It’s a reaction against waterfall therefore it focuses on breaking up work into smaller increments called sprints. This is a 
                            continuous process and adaptive to change.</li> 
                    </ul>

                        </a> -->

                    <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
                    <p>It's a process broken down into sprints that take about 2 weeks and includes 4 ceremonies:</p>

                    <h3>Sprint planning</h3>
                        <p>  
                            The work to be performed (scope) during the current sprint is planned during this meeting by the entire development team. 
                            This meeting is led by the scrum master and is where the team decides on the sprint goal.At the end of the planning meeting, 
                            every scrum member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.
                        </p>
                        

                    <h3>Daily Scrum or Stand Up</h3>
                        <p>Short morning meetings (about 15 mins) to ensure people are aligned with the sprint goal for next 24hrs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What did I do yesterday?</li>
                            <li>What do I plan to do today?</li>
                            <li>Are there any obstacles?</li>
                        </ul>
                        

                    <h3>Sprint Reviews</h3>
                        <p>
                            Team gathers to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment at the end of the sprint. Development team forwards the completed
                            backlog tasks to stakeholders and teammates for feedback. If not up to scratch the product owner can decide whether or not 
                            to release the increment.
                        </p>
                        

                    <h3>Sprint Retrospective</h3>
                        <p>
                            Documentation of fails and successes in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, or even for certain ceremonies. 
                            This helps teams to highlight what needs to be improved for next time.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Scrum product owner</h3>

                            the engineers based on their understanding. Product managers aren’t always the product owners. P.S there is only one product
                            owner per team. 
                        </p>

                            <li>Build and manage the product backlog.</li>
                            <li>Closely work with the business and the team to ensure everyone goals are aligned according to the product backlog.</li>
                            <li>Give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next.</li>
                            <li>Decide when to ship the product and trying to do it frequently.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Scrum development team</h3> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>The workforce who see the sustainability of scrum through</li>
                            <li>Team is big enough to share 2 pizzas (according to Jeff Bezos)</li>
                            <li>Different skillsets but have a ‘we’ attitude thus making sure that no-one becomes a bottleneck by cross training.</li>
